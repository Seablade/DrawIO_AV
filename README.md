# DrawIO_AV
A library of AV symbols for Draw.IO

The intention is that these symbols form the basis for AV drawings in Draw.IO.  To use them you will need to import the coded url of the XML file into Draw.IO

Also included is a Template.drawio file intended to be opened in draw.io that includes the symbols and information on how to use them.
